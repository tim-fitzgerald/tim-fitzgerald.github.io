# About me

Thank you for stopping by. I'm Tim.

### Professional
I am a Client/IT Systems Engineer and leader working in SaaS style environments. I enjoy bringing an engineering approach to an IT department - leveraging infrastructure as code where possible, and leaning into building novel custom solutions when they don't already exist (or are prohibitively expensive). I love picking things apart, learning how they work, and sharing that with others. If you're really interested in the tools I work with and skills I have built up you can check that out [here](/tools).

I'm also deeply passionate about an open community in tech. I would not know half of what I know if it weren't for the kindness of random strangers on the MacAdmins Slack. If you want to reach out to chat to me about anything I happen to know something about please hit me up `@tim.fitzgerald` on that Slack, or via hi@timfitzgerald.net.

### Personal
I am lucky enough to live on the unceded ancestral territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. I can be found climbing, mountain biking, snowboarding, and hiking in the BC mountains. My background is in music technology, and I still spend a large portion of my time playing indulgent techno on a small modular synth setup along with an Elektron Digitakt.
